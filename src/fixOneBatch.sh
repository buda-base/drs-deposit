# script to collect imagegroups into a batch for processing via BatchBuilder and
# upload to Harvard Digital Repository Service
#
# this script is called as follows:
#
#     fix-one-batch.sh workVolumes  targetProject  bbDir
#
# the arguments are:
#		targetProject	is the name of the project that will contain the generated batches
#
#		bbDir			this is the path to the directory containing batchbuildercli.sh and
#						supporting files - i.e., the BatchBuilder install. See the harvard-drs
#						SVN in TBRCTools/scripts or visit:
#
#							http://hul.harvard.edu/ois/systems/drs/drs2-software.html
#
# Processing:
# After some setup of source and targets, this script's main processing loop:
#   - Reads each line of the input file
#   - It's either a header line, which creates a new batch project, or it's
#       a data line, which gives the volume which will be added as an object in the
#       current batch project.
#
# Adding to an existing batch:
# This script copies and renames the images in each imagegroup of each Work listed in the
# worksList. The images are copied into the project/template/image directory.
#
# Then the batchbuildercli.sh is called to create the batch directory structure in the 
# project directory. After this, the batchbuildercli.sh is called again to create the control
# files: batch.xml and descriptor.xml which are used to control the DRS import.
#
# The approach is to copy the projectMaster to make a new project that will contain a batch for
# for each Work to be deposited.
#
# For each batch / Work need to run saxon to prepare the project.conf file
# with the Hollis ID for the Work - this is in lieu of generating a really
# long command line. The saxon needs to be run like:
#
#    java -jar saxonhe-9.4.0.7.jar the-project.conf make-proj-conf.xsl hId=the-hollis-id
